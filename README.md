### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Vladislav Kim ðŸ’»

Currently styding in Yandex Praktikum ðŸŽ“  
Courteous and enthusiastic, I am interested in IT and everything in its orbit. I recently began to be fascinated by web programming
As this area complements my studies, I am keen to gain more experience in the field. For this reason, I am looking for a company willing to offer me a placement among their developers. In return, I would offer my full commitment, and be a pleasant and friendly addition to your team.
I am therefore currently looking for a job or an internship as a front-end developer.
